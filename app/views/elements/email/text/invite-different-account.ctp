User <?= $email_from; ?> from Prospector wants you to join his account. I know this is lame, but you can't join his account with this email address because you already have a Prospector account with this email. 

Don't worry! The fix is simple. Just email <?= $email_from; ?> and give him another email address he can use to invite you to his account.

<?php echo $this->element('email-signature'); ?>
